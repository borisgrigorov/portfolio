        I'm a developer and current student with a long-standing passion for new technologies that
        began at a young age. Specializing in web applications, mobile apps, and backend
        development. In every project, I strive to create applications that have real-world impact,
        bringing practical solutions that enhance our daily lives. When I'm not working, I love
        exploring and learning about new technologies, continually expanding my skills and
        knowledge. Outside of development, my passion for music adds a creative balance, inspiring
        fresh ideas and energy in my work.
